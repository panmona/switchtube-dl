Download the `.deb` package for your architecture from
the [latest release](https://github.com/panmona/switchtube-dl/releases/latest) and install it with your package manager.

### macOS

brew install panmona/panmona/switchtube-dl

### Windows

Download the [latest windows release](https://github.com/panmona/switchtube-dl/releases/latest) zip for your

If Emoji are not displaying correctly in your terminal refer to [this documentation](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console/blob/main/docs/input/best-practices.md#configuring-the-windows-terminal-for-unicode-and-emoji-support).

## Getting Started

After installation generate an API Token from your [SwitchTube Profile](https://tube.switch.ch/access_tokens) and save
it to an appropriate place.

You will need this token for every download that you run.

## Usage

> **Please note** that you should be gentle when downloading videos in parallel as noted in the [official API docs](https://tube.switch.ch/api#accessing-the-web-service):
>
> `Please be gentle with the servers because hammering the web service will also decrease performance of the web site.`

### Download a video

```bash
switchtube-dl -v 123456
```

### Channel download

```bash
switchtube-dl -c 123456
```

It will per default start in interactive mode and output a table of all videos in this channel:

```
Index │ Title              │ Duration │    Date
──────┼────────────────────┼──────────┼────────────
    1 │ Video A            │ 00:09:39 │ 2020-07-08
    2 │ Video B            │ 00:09:39 │ 2020-09-09
    3 │ Video C            │ 00:15:16 │ 2020-09-09
    4 │ Video D            │ 00:11:45 │ 2020-09-09
    5 │ Video E            │ 00:06:04 │ 2020-09-09
    6 │ Video F            │ 00:08:16 │ 2020-09-09
    7 │ Video G            │ 00:12:25 │ 2021-11-30
    8 │ Video H            │ 00:11:12 │ 2022-02-07
    9 │ Video I            │ 01:03:00 │ 2022-02-09
```

To choose which videos to download, specify indices of the videos separated by commas like: `1,4,5,6` if you want to
download the videos indexed 1,4,5,6 of the channel.

You can specify a range, for example `1-3,5,7-9` will download the videos at index 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9.

#### Filter options

If you don't want to use interactive mode for the channel download there are the following filter options:

##### All videos

With `-a` or `--all` all videos in the channel are downloaded.

### Global options

##### Existing file handling

Per default the CLI exits when it notices that a file already exists under the same name. If you want a different
behavior there are two strategies defined.

###### Overwrite

If already existing files should be overwritten use `-f` or `--force`.

###### Skip

If already existing files should be skipped use `-s` or `--skip`. If both options are provided skip is prioritized.

#### Path

Per default the files are downloaded to the directory from where the CLI is invoked. If you want to provide a different
path use `-p` or `--path`. This path must be **absolute** and **exist**.
